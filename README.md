## ArrayList

`ArrayList` is a class in the `java.util` package that implements the `List` interface and provides a dynamic array-like data structure. It allows you to store and manipulate a collection of elements.

This is an implementation of the ArrayList from scratch to understand the complexity of each function and how each built-in function works. 


### Features

- **Dynamic Size**: Unlike regular arrays, `ArrayList` automatically adjusts size as elements are added or removed.
- **Random Access**: An index can access elements in `ArrayList` directly.
- **Flexible Operations**: `ArrayList` provides various methods to add, remove, and modify elements, making it versatile for data manipulation.

### Usage

To use `ArrayList`, you need to import the `java.util` package:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
